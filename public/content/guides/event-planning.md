# Event Planning Basics (This is a placeholder, not accurate)

## Getting Permits

When organizing events on campus, you'll need to navigate the university's permit system...

## Venue Selection

Consider these factors when choosing a location:
- Accessibility for all participants
- Sound amplification rules
- Expected attendance
- Weather backup plans

## Timeline Planning

Start planning at least 4-6 weeks in advance:

1. **6 weeks before**: Submit permit applications
2. **4 weeks before**: Confirm speakers and materials
3. **2 weeks before**: Promote heavily on social media
4. **1 week before**: Final headcount and logistics
